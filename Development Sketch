This is an initial attempt at a simple sketch to bring functionality to the
valve controller. Simple 2 wire sensor monitoring on a digital pin which in
turn controls two mechanical relays; One for input line pressure (flow), the second
for output line pressure (flow). This could be tweaked to operate a single valve,
or both independently. No additional monitoring, IOT capability, UI, or alarms are
captured in this version (in dev). Full disclosure, I am an ME, not a SW Dev, this is
just what I do for my personal enjoyment.
